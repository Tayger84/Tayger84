- 👋 Hello, I’m Josef Duris (**Josef Ďuriš** in czech language)
  
- 👀 I am passionate about programming in Python. What does coding mean to me? It feels a lot like writing a story, especially when working with objects. I’m always amazed when I discover a new way to use a command on Codewars or in code written by an experienced programmer. My goal is to reach their level and become a senior developer.
